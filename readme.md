# Collaboration Opportunity: Secure US Developer Roles Together  

Are you a skilled developer based in North America or Europe looking to break into high-quality contracting roles in the US? I’m looking for a reliable collaborator to work with me on an innovative approach to securing these opportunities.  

## The Idea  

Together, we’ll leverage popular platforms like:  
- LinkedIn  
- Indeed  
- Craigslist  
- Dice  
- ZipRecruiter  

to find lucrative US-based contracting opportunities.  

### How We’ll Work  

#### My Role:  
- **Initial Outreach**: I’ll handle the job search and schedule meetings with recruiters using a strong US-based profile.  
- **Technical Support**: During your technical interviews, I’ll provide backup support if needed.  

#### Your Role:  
- **Meetings & Interviews**: You’ll attend meetings with recruiters, demonstrate your technical expertise, and pass interviews.  
- **Daily Responsibilities**: After securing a role, you’ll attend daily standups and contribute as a core team member.  

### What Happens Next?  
Once we secure a position:  
- I’ll hire an additional developer to assist with your workload.  
- Payments will be handled professionally. The client company will issue a 1099 tax form to my business, and I’ll ensure you’re compensated fairly.  

This is a well-established contract setup, and I’m confident that with our combined efforts, we’ll secure exciting opportunities quickly.
